Before the job time is gone you can schedure a restart for your process automatically. 

1) configure your restart.pbs as usually

2) calculate what is the time/hour the job will be stopped. We will give two examples

- Ex1: Now is 9:22, the jobs will stopped when complete 48h and thus it will finished on 12:34. You can give some minutes only (just in case) and schedule the restart as follows: 

bash> at 12:40
at>qsub restart.pbs
control-D

- Ex2: the time will be elapsed tomorrow at 6h02 in the morning. You can proceed as in the previous example just changing the command as follows:

bash> at 6:02 tomorrow
at>qsub restart.pbs
control-D

More 'at' commands are possible, we've consulted this reference: https://www.computerhope.com/unix/uat.htm
